# PythonDualLoginSystem
Python Dual Login system provides Facial Recognition simultaneously with manual login using id and passcodes.

# How to use.
For first time use it will automatically create required Folders and open a tkinter window and ask to create a model of face then, 
after creating the face model the app will close. then again after restarting the app, the system will be fully functional.

## Note : Currently the sometimes give error index out of range error and face recognition doesnt starts in that case delete the model.png in IMGD folder and try making new face model

# For windows:
in the installation of library Face recognition most of user face issues as it requires Visual Studio Build tools installed
